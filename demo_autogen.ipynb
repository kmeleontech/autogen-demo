        "# Microsoft AutoGen - Kmeleon Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "Microsoft AutoGen is a framework that enables the development of applications using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. LLMs are powerful AI systems that can generate natural language texts for various tasks, such as writing, summarizing, translating, and answering questions. However, LLMs also have some limitations, such as being prone to errors, biases, and safety issues. Therefore, using LLMs effectively requires a lot of effort and expertise to design, implement, and optimize a workflow that can leverage their full potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen simplifies this process by allowing you to create customizable and conversable agents that can use LLMs, tools, and human inputs to solve tasks. These agents can communicate with each other through automated chat to coordinate their actions and exchange information. For example, you can create an agent that can write code based on natural language instructions, another agent that can check the code for errors and safety, and another agent that can execute the code and provide feedback. By automating chat among multiple capable agents, tasks can be performed autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen also provides a collection of working systems with different complexities that span a wide range of applications from various domains. These systems demonstrate how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns and workflows. Moreover, AutoGen provides an enhanced inference API that allows easy performance tuning, utilities like caching and error handling, and advanced usage patterns such as context programming and multi-config inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen is powered by collaborative research studies from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington. You can learn more about AutoGen from the following sources:\n",
